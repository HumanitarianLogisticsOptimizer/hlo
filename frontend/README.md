# Installation

You'll need to install Node.js >=v14.16+ (Recommended Version) (NPM comes along with it), and **Vite** is used for frontend tooling. To perform installation and build production version, please follow the steps below:

- Use the terminal and navigate to the project root.
- Then run: `npm install`
- Then run: `npm run dev`

Now, in the browser, go to `localhost:5173`

## **For Production Build**

Run: `npm run build`

Default build output directory: /dist

This command will generate a dist as build folder in the root of your template that you can upload to your server.
